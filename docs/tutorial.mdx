webapp.io connects directly to your GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab repository and runs everytime you make a commit to a repository that contains a [Layerfile](/layerfile-reference/what-are-layerfiles)

In this sense, there's no traditional installation (you don't need to download a CLI tool), all you need is a `Layerfile` in a repository that's connected to webapp.io.

## Project Breakdown

To view the power of preview environments in action, let's go through an example
with our open-source version of Slack,
[Livechat Example](https://github.com/webappio/livechat-example), that uses
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). For the purpose of this
quickstart guide, the codebase is monorepository, so all of the services are
within a single folder (/services).

Our Livechat Example contains the following within the `/services` folder:

- `/api` (our api to handle all requests)
- `/cypress` (for running tests)
- `/migrate` (for populating our database)
- `/web` (our React frontend)

Most importantly, in the root directory, we have our **Layerfile** which is a
**set of instructions that tells webapp.io how to install, build, and run** the
Livechat Example. This Layerfile for our Livechat example is shown below:

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# install the latest version of Docker, as in the official Docker installation tutorial.
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release && \
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings && \
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg && \
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" |\
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Install docker-compose
RUN curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Copy repository files
COPY / /root

RUN /root/pull-images.sh
RUN REPEATABLE docker-compose build --parallel
RUN BACKGROUND docker-compose up

# EXPOSE WEBSITE creates an internet visible link
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:8000

```

## Comprehensive step-by-step Tutorial

### 1. Fork Example Repo

Go to the [GitHub repository for the Livechat example](https://github.com/webappio/livechat-example) and fork the repository.

### 2. Clone To Local

Clone the new Livechat Example repository to your local machine.

Click on the "Code" button to get the URL to clone locally.

```bash Shell
git clone (INSERT URL HERE)
```

### 3. Sign up to webapp.io

[Sign up to webapp.io](https://webapp.io/sign-up) and install webapp.io on your GitHub account, **ensuring that webapp.io has access to the repository you created.**

### 4. Make a Local Change

Make a change to the project locally, and push your changes to the repository you created.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "making some change to Livechat example"
git push
```

### 5. View Website

Go to your dashboard on webapp.io to see your run, click on “Details”,“main-layerfile”, then “View website”.

<img className="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/run-page.png" />

<img className="rounded" src="https://webapp.io/static/assets/detail-page.png" />

Click on "main-layerfile" here, followed by "View Website".

### 6. View Preview Environment

Wait for the server to start, you'll be redirected to a preview environment with the Livechat Example.

/>

That's all you need to view the full-stack preview environment with webapp.io!
Next, try making another change to one of the views (i.e., in
`/services/web/src/views/login/login.js`) and push a new commit to see another
preview environment with your changes.
