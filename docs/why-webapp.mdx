## The Problems

If you're using Cypress, Test Cafe, Selenium, or any other testing library for a
full-stack webapp, you've probably faced significant problems when running them
in CI:

### 1. It's hard to start webservers in traditional CI

After setting up CI/CD for a webapp, the next step is often creating a copy of
the entire app in order to run end-to-end tests.

Without webapp.io, there are two common approaches to doing this in CI:

- Use your production cloud provider, and create staging environments ($$$,
  slow)
- Start the stack for the duration of the pipeline (slow, hard to debug)

**How webapp.io solves this problem:**

Instead of using a YAML file to configure CI/CD in webapp.io, our users create a
Layerfile. Here's an example:

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/node:14
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
RUN BACKGROUND npm run start
EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:3000
```

This syntax is borrowed from Docker's configuration, and makes it really easy to
speed up builds. In this case, we'd skip running `npm install` for subsequent
pipelines unless you change `package.json`.

### 2. It's hard to review visual changes

Web apps changes are often subjective. Unit tests won't tell you if changing
`color: #fefdfa` to `color: #dabdab` will interfere with contrast and readability on your site.

Ultimately reviewers need to check out the change and try it out themselves in
order to determine if it's ok or not.

**How webapp.io solves this problem:**

After making their webapp.io configuration, users can add a single
`EXPOSE WEBSITE localhost:3000` directive to embed a full-stack preview
environment directly into every pull request.

### 3. When builds fail, it's hard to understand why

Usual CI systems make it hard to debug webapp failures by restricting users to
only looking at logs.

**How webapp.io solves this problem:**

Webapp.io embeds debugging terminals below every failed build automatically.

### 4. It takes many clicks to get feedback

Most CI/CD systems use a "checks API" to give a pass/fail metric for a pull
request.

For example, they might tell you whether a build failed or if a unit test
passed.

However, webapps have many numerical metrics like page speed that aren't
necessarily pass/fail.

**How webapp.io solves this problem:**

Webapp.io allows you to embed customizable widgets into your pull requests so
that reviewers can see details about a specific change at a glance.
