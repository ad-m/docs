Webapp.io has a Layerfile Extension for VS Code to help when editing your Layerfile in local development.

You can find the extension in VS Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webappio.layerfile-extension).

To install the extension locally, open VS Code and go to the `Extensions` section. Search the marketplace for `Layerfile Extensions` and simply click the `Install` button.

Your project will now be configured to lint Layerfiles.
