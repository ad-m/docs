webapp.io has a Layerfile Extension for VS Code to help with editing your Layerfile before pushing to a repository [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webappio.layerfile-extension).

To install the extenstion locally, open VS Code and go to the "Extensions" section. Search the marketplace for "Layerfile Extensions" and simply click the "Instal" button.

Your project will now be configured to lint Layerfiles.
