`FROM [source]`

The `FROM` instruction tells webapp.io what base to use to run tests from.

There can only be one `FROM` line in a Layerfile, and it must always be the
first directive in the Layerfile.

For now, only `FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04` is allowed as a top level, but inheriting
from other Layerfiles is possible.

<Info>
Node v18 is currently not supported by Ubuntu 18.04. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/issues/1392) for more details.

To build a project with Node v18, consider using Docker or Docker Compose. A tutorial can be found [here](/examples/node-18).

### Examples

- Use `FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04` to use ubuntu:18.04 as the base.
- Use `FROM ../base` to inherit from the file at `../base/Layerfile` relative to
  the current Layerfile
- Use `FROM /base` to inherit from the file at `(repo root)/base/Layerfile)`
- Use `FROM webapp.io/rails:2.7.1` to inherit from the
  [shared Layerfile library](https://webapp.io/library) configuration `rails:2.7.1`
- Use `FROM my-org/base:v1.0.0` to inherit from a common image for your
  organization in the [shared Layerfile library](https://webapp.io/library)
