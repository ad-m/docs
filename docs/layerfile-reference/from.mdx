title: "FROM"

`FROM [source]`

The `FROM` instruction tells webapp.io what base to use to run tests from.

There can only be one `FROM` line in a Layerfile, and it must always be the
first directive in the Layerfile.

For now, only `FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04` and `FROM vm/ubuntu:22.04` are allowed as a top level, but inheriting
from other Layerfiles is possible.

<Info>
Ubuntu 22.04 is only supported if the "Use new hypervisor for faster snapshots" setting is enabled, otherwise the run will fail with an internal error.
</Info>

### Examples

- Use `FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04` to use ubuntu:18.04 as the base.
- Use `FROM ../base` to inherit from the file at `../base/Layerfile` relative to
  the current Layerfile
- Use `FROM /base` to inherit from the file at `(repo root)/base/Layerfile)`
- Use `FROM webapp.io/rails:2.7.1` to inherit from the
  [shared Layerfile library](https://webapp.io/library) configuration `rails:2.7.1`
- Use `FROM my-org/base:v1.0.0` to inherit from a common image for your
  organization in the [shared Layerfile library](https://webapp.io/library)
