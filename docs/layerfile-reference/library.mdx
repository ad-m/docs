`FROM` can inherit `Layerfile` configurations from the internet.

The [Layerfile library](https://webapp.io/library) contains configurations that we've pre-created
like `FROM webapp.io/docker:20.10`. It also lets you define your own shared
configurations from scratch.

If your organization is called `my-org`, you could define `my-org/base:v1.0.0`
to install the base dependencies for your organization, and then the Layerfiles
in all of your repositories could use `FROM my-org/base:v1.0.0` to re-use build
layers and configurations.
