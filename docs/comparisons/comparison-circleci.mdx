title: "webapp.io vs CircleCI"
---

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a popular and well established Continuous Integration service.

### Price comparison
webapp.io charges a flat fee per developer, whereas CircleCI has a usage-based "credit" system.

For a team with:
- 10 developers
- 50 commits per day
- 8 parallel CI tasks per commit
- 10 minutes of compute per task
- 4 vCPUs per runner
- Docker Layer Caching (docker builds)

CircleCI would charge:
- 125,000 credits for seats
- 80,000 credits for docker layer caching
- 1,760,000 credits for runners (Linux VM large, 50 commits * 22 work days * 80 minutes * 20 credits/min)

In total, CircleCI would charge $1160/mo on the performance plan.

Webapp.io would charge:
- $49 per seat, or $490/mo on the team plan.

<Info>
CircleCI price ~$1160/mo on the performance plan
webapp.io price - $490/mo on the team plan ($390/mo/year on an annual subscription)

### When would you choose Webapp.io over CircleCI?

Webapp.io is specifically built for full-stack webapps, so it comes with features which aren't included in CircleCI.

#### Skipping steps automatically with our file watcher

Webapp.io has a powerful caching system which automatically makes builds faster:

- As your build progresses, webapp.io monitors which files are used by which build steps at the hardware level.
- For example, you don't have to micromanage cache keys for steps like `npm install` or `docker build`, because we'll know which files are used by those steps.
- This would often mean 2x - 10x faster builds for common webapp workloads like starting databases and installing dependencies with no extra configuration.
- For more information, see the [webapp.io tuning performance documentation](/tuning-performance/the-layerfile-cache)

#### Share docker build state with RUN REPEATABLE

Instead of pushing/pulling docker images to a registry like [CircleCI's docker layer caching](https://circleci.com/docs/docker-layer-caching/), webapp.io has a directive to completely share the state of a build to a subsequent build with the [RUN REPEATABLE](/tuning-performance/run-repeatable) directive.

In general, this means significantly faster Docker builds at no extra cost, since the runner can share all of its images and build cache from previous builds.

#### Always-available debug terminal

If a CircleCI build fails, you can re-run it with instrumentation enabled using the [Rerun job with SSH](https://circleci.com/docs/ssh-access-jobs/) feature. The instance will run for **two hours billing at the usual rate**, and then shut off.

In contrast, when a webapp.io build fails, the VM is hibernated and kept around - a button to "view debugging terminal" is available below the run logs, and will automatically wake up the instance and set up a SSH connection via your browser.
