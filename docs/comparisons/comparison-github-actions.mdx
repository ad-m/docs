title: "webapp.io vs Github Actions"
---

[Github Actions (GHA)](https://github.com/actions/) is a first-party Continuous Integration offering by GitHub, focusing on triggering certain actions when certain events occur.

### Price comparison
webapp.io charges a flat fee per developer, whereas Github Actions charges per minute of compute time.

For a team with:
- 10 developers
- 50 commits per day
- 8 parallel CI tasks per commit
- 10 minutes of compute per task
- 6 vCPUs per runner
- Docker Layer Caching (docker builds)

Github Actions would charge:
- $2816 (Linux VM, 50 commits * 22 work days * 80 minutes * $0.032/min)

Webapp.io would charge:
- $49 per seat, or $490/mo on the team plan.

### When would you choose Webapp.io over Github Actions?

Webapp.io is specifically built for full-stack webapps, so it comes with several "killer features" which aren't included in Github Actions.

#### Skipping steps automatically with our file watcher

Webapp.io has a powerful caching system which automatically makes builds faster:

- As your build progresses, webapp.io monitors which files are used by which build steps at the hardware level.
- For example, you don't have to micromanage cache keys for steps like `npm install` or `docker build`, because we'll know which files are used by those steps.
- This would often mean 2x - 10x faster builds for common webapp workloads like starting databases and installing dependencies with no extra configuration.
- For more information, see the [webapp.io tuning performance documentation](/tuning-performance/the-layerfile-cache)

#### Share docker build state with RUN REPEATABLE

Webapps often require building and starting many Docker containers for things like databases, backends, and caches.

Companies wanting to run the equivalent of `docker-compose build` would have to use third party actions and push/pull from a registry when using Github Actions.

In comparison, webapp.io has a directive to completely share the state of a build to a subsequent build with the [RUN REPEATABLE](/tuning-performance/run-repeatable) directive.

This means your team has significantly faster Docker builds at no extra cost, since the runner can share all of its images and build cache from previous builds.

The configuration in webapp.io would look as simple as `RUN REPEATABLE docker-compose build --parallel`

#### Always-available debug terminal

When a webapp.io build fails, the VM is hibernated and kept around - a button to "view debugging terminal" is available below the run logs, and will automatically wake up the instance and set up a SSH connection via your browser.

This means failures which aren't immediately obvious from the terminal output can be effortlessly debugged using webapp.io.
