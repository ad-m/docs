## Setting up the React Application

**(You can skip this section if you already have a React app running.)**

To build your React application, ensure you have node, npm, and npx installed.
You can verify with the following commands:

- `node --version`

- `npm --version`

- `npx --version`

If installed correctly these will both give you a number as an output.

After installed, go to a folder and run the following command
`npx create-react-app [app_name]` (where `[app_name]` is the name of your
application). This will create a new React app in the folder '[app_name]'.

Once your app is finished installing, go into your directory with the command
`cd [app_name]`, and run the command `npm start`. This will open the React
application on your computer at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now go in and
change the title of the page or make another change to your React application to
see the changes in effect.

### Summary of Steps:

1.  `node --version`

2.  `npm --version`

3.  `npx --version`

4.  `npx create-react-app [app_name]`

5.  `cd [app_name]`

6.  `npm start`

## Layerfile

Listed below is an example Layerfile for webapp.io which you can use to setup a
basic React application. We'll breakdown this Layerfile in the section below for
a set of detailed explanation on what each one of the instructions do.

```docker Layerfile
# Set the image
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

MEMORY 2G

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
RUN sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN sudo npm install npm@latest -g

ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192

COPY . .

RUN npm install

RUN BACKGROUND npm start

EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:3000
```

## Setting up the Layerfile

If you haven't already, please sign up to [webapp.io](/sign-up), and install
webapp.io onto your repository.

First let's breakdown each instruction in our Layerfile.

### 1: Set the Image

`FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04`

The `FROM` instruction tells webapp.io what base to use to run tests from. There
can only be one `FROM` line, and in this case we're using the `ubuntu:18.04`
virtual machine image.

If you're familiar with AWS Ec2 Instances, this is similar to creating a virtual
machine from the ubuntu 18.04 image.

### 2: Set the Memory

`MEMORY 2G`

The `MEMORY` instruction allows you to specify how much memory your environment
uses. In this case we use `MEMORY 2G` to ensure that at least 2GB of memory are
available.

### 3. Install NodeJS and NPM

`RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`RUN sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

`RUN sudo npm install npm@latest -g`

The `RUN` instruction will run the given script, and fails the Layerfile if the
script fails. In this case, we're using the `RUN` command to install the
dependencies we need to build and run the React application.

In this case we're using the `RUN` instruction to download Node JS and npm.

### 4. Set Node Space Size

`ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192`

The `ENV` instruction persistently sets environment variables in the Layerfile.
In this case, the `NODE_OPTIONS` gets set to a specific size so that it can be
consumed later in the React start process.

### 5. Get Repository Files

`COPY . .`

The `COPY` instruction moves files from your repository to the virtual machine.
The Layerfile will pick up on the files in the repository that you are making
the commit for, and will copy those files into the virtual machine so you can
run you project.

### 6. Install Dependencies

`RUN npm install`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given script
`npm install`, which will install the dependencies for the React app.

### 7. Start the React app

`RUN BACKGROUND npm start`

The `RUN BACKGROUND` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/run) is the `RUN`
instruction with the `BACKGROUND` flag. This tells webapp.io to continue to the
next step in the Layerfile instead of waiting for the given script to run. The
reason why we do this is that `npm start` will essentially block the terminal
while the React app is running. We want to continue to the next step so that's
why we use `RUN BACKGROUND` here.

### 8. Expose React App on the Virtual Machine

`EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:3000`

The`EXPOSE WEBSITE` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/expose-website) creates
a link to view the virtual machine at a specific port. We use `EXPOSE WEBSITE`
to expose the virtual machine on port 3000 which is where the React application
runs after running `npm start`. We use `EXPOSE WEBSITE` here so we can get a
link to our React app to share with stakeholders involved in our projects.

## Adding the Layerfile

The last step in this process is to add the Layerfile to your repository. Simply
create a file called `Layerfile` (no file extension) in the root of your React
application. If you haven't already, install webapp.io onto your repository
containing your React app. Once done, simply create a commit and push your React
app to the repository with the new Layerfile. Webapp.io will pick up on the
Layerfile and build your React application according to the steps in your
Layerfile.
