## Setting up the Docker Compose Application

**(You can skip this section if you already have an application using Docker
Compose running.)**

For this example we're going to build an application that uses Express JS as our
server (backend) with a React JS client (frontend). Our application will use
Docker Compose to serve both the client and the server.

To build your React frontend and Express backend, ensure you have node, npm,
npx, Docker, and Docker Compose installed. You can verify with the following
commands:

- `node --version`

- `npm --version`

- `npx --version`

- `docker`

- `docker-compose`

If installed correctly these will give you an output in the terminal.

After installed, create a new folder to store your project with
`mkdir [app_name]`, and go to that directory with `cd [app_name]`.

First, let's set up the Express backend. Create a new folder called server with
`mkdir server`, and go to that directory with `cd server`.

In the server folder, run the following commands:

- `npm init`

- `npm install express`

Once installed, create a new file in the folder called `app.js` and add the
following code:

```javascript app.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 5001;
const cors = require("cors");

const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if ((!origin, callback)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error("not allowed bycors"));
    }
  },
  credentials: true,
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.get("/api/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
app.post("/api/get-data", (req, res) => {
  res.send({ text: "webapp.io" });
});
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Next create a file called `Dockerfile` in the `server` folder with the following
code:

```docker Dockerfile
FROM node:18-buster
RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install --production
CMD ["node", "app.js"];
EXPOSE 5001
```

Once those files are added, go back to the root folder with `cd ..`.

In the root folder, run the following command `npx create-react-app client`.
This will create your React app. Once the installation has finished, cd into the
directory with `cd client`.NewTabIcon

Once in the client, create a file called `Dockerfile` with the following
contents:

```docker Dockerfile
FROM node:18-buster
RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make WORKDIR
/app ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH COPY package.json ./ COPY package-lock.json
./ RUN npm install COPY . . CMD ["npm", "start"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

Next, change the content of `client/src/App.js` to the following:

```javascript /client/src/App.js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/get-data", { method: "POST" }).then(async (res) => {
      const data = await res.json();
      if (data?.text) {
        setData(data.text);
      } else {
        setData("No Data Received.");
      }
    });
  });
  return <div>Data Received: {data}</div>;
};

export default App;
```

In this JS file we're using fetch to request data from our Express backend.

Lastly, change the content of `client/package.json` by adding the following line
`"proxy": "http://localhost:5001",`.

```json client/package.json
{
  "name": "client",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5001",
  "private": true,
  ...
}
```

Once these changes are made, go back to your root folder with `cd ..`. Once in
the root folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  server:
    build: ./server
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
    volumes:
      - ./server:/app
  client:
    build: ./client
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./client:/app
    depends_on:
      - server
```

After you've made the above changes, run the command `docker-compose up` to
start your application.

### Summary of Steps:

1. `node --version`

## Layerfile

Listed below is an example Layerfile for webapp.io which you can use to setup
the Docker Compose application. We'll breakdown this Layerfile in the section
below for a set of detailed explanation on what each one of the instructions do.

```docker Layerfile
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release && \
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings && \
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg && \
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" |\

RUN npm install

WORKDIR /root/server
RUN npm install

RUN docker-compose up -d

EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:3000 /
```

## Setting up the Layerfile

If you haven't already, please sign up to [webapp.io](/sign-up), and install
webapp.io onto your repository.

First let's breakdown each instruction in our Layerfile.

### 1: Set the Image

### `FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04`

The [instruction](../layerfile-reference/memory) tells webapp.io what base to
use to run tests from. There can only be one `FROM` line, and in this case we're
using the `ubuntu:18.04` virtual machine image.

If you're familiar with AWS Ec2 Instances, this is similar to creating a virtual
machine from the ubuntu 18.04 image.

### 2: Set the Memory

### `MEMORY 2G`

The [instruction](../layerfile-reference/memory) allows you to specify how much
memory your environment uses. In this case we use `MEMORY 2G` to ensure that at
least 2GB of memory are available.

### 3. Install Docker

```Layerfile
# install the latest version of Docker, as in the official Docker installation tutorial.
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release && \
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings && \
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg && \
    echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" |\
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

The [instruction](../layerfile-reference/run) will run the given script, and
fails the Layerfile if the script fails. In this case, we're using the `RUN`
command to install the dependencies we need to build and run the React
application.

In this case we're using the `RUN` instruction to download Docker.

### 4. Install Docker Compose

`RUN curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-'uname -s'-'uname -m' -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

`RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given script, which
will install docker compose on the virtual machine so we can run
`docker-compose up`.

### 5. Install React

`RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`RUN sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

`RUN sudo npm install npm@latest -g`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given scripts to
install Node JS and npm which are both needed for React.

### 6. Set Node Space Size

`ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192`

The [instruction](../layerfile-reference/env) persistently sets environment
variables in the Layerfile. In this case, the `NODE_OPTIONS` gets set to a
specific size so that it can be consumed later in the React start process.

### 7. Verify Docker Compose is installed

`RUN docker-compose --version`

This `RUN` instruction step is not needed, however we're adding it here to check
if the virtual machine installed Docker Compose successfully.

### 8. Get Repository Files

`COPY . .`

The `COPY` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/copy) moves files from your
repository to the virtual machine. The Layerfile will pick up on the files in
the repository that you are making the commit for, and will copy those files
into the virtual machine so you can run you project.

### 9. Install Client Dependencies

`WORKDIR client`

`RUN npm install`

The `RUN` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/workdir) instruction changes the
location from which files are resolved in the runner.

### 10. Install Server Dependencies

`WORKDIR /root/server`

`RUN npm install`

Similar to the instruction above, these steps navigate to the Server folder and
add all the dependencies needed.

### 11. Run Application with Docker Compose

`RUN docker-compose up -d`

After installing all dependencies we run `docker-compose up -d` to start our
React and Server applications.

### 12. Expose Server Endpoint on the Virtual Machine

`EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:5001 /api`

The `EXPOSE WEBSITE` [instruction](../layerfile-reference/expose-website)
creates a link to view the virtual machine at a specific port. We use
`EXPOSE WEBSITE` to expose the virtual machine on port 3000 which is where the
React application runs after running `npm start`. We use `EXPOSE WEBSITE` here
so we can get a link to our React app to share with stakeholders involved in our
projects.

This line is especially important since all requests to the `/api` endpoint will
hit our server running on `port:5001`.

### 13. Expose Client Endpoint on the Virtual Machine

`EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:3000 /`

Similar to the instruction above `EXPOSE CLIENT` exposes the preview environment
at port 3000. After expose, you can head to the preview environment link to see
it in action.

This line is especially important since all requests to the `/api` endpoint will
hit our server running on `port:5001`.

## Adding the Layerfile

The last step in this process is to add the Layerfile to your repository. Simply
create a file called `Layerfile` (no file extension) in the root of your React
application. If you haven't already, install webapp.io onto your repository
containing your full-stack app. Once done, simply create a commit and push your
React app to the repository with the new Layerfile. Webapp.io will pick up on
the Layerfile and build your application according to the steps in your
Layerfile.
