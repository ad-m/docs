## Setting up the Angular Application

**(You can skip this section if you already have an Angular app running.)**

To build your Angular application, ensure you have both node and npm installed.
You can verify with the following commands: `node --version` `npm --version`. If
installed correctly these will both give you a number as an output.

Next, install the Angular CLI with `npm install -g @angular/cli`;

After installed, go to a folder and run the following command
`ng new webappio-angular-example`. This will create a new Angular app in the
folder 'webappio-angular-example'. When running this command, you'll be prompted
to use Angular routing (we selected yes), and select a stylesheet (we selected
SCSS).

Once your app is finished installing, go into your directory with the command
`cd webappio-angular-example`, and run the command `ng serve -o --poll=2000`.
This will open the angular application on your computer on your localhost. You
can now go in and change the title of the page or make another change to your
Angular application to see the changes in effect.

Summary of Steps:

1. `node --version`
2. `npm --version`
3. `npm install -g @angular/cli`
4. `ng new webappio-angular-example`
5. `cd webappio-angular-example`
6. `ng serve -o --poll=2000`

## Layerfile

Listed below is an example Layerfile for webapp.io which you can use to setup a
basic Angular application. We'll breakdown this Layerfile in the section below
for a set of detailed explanation on what each one of the instructions do.

```docker Layerfile
# Set the image
FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04

# Install nodejs and npm
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
RUN sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
RUN sudo npm install npm@latest -g

# Install angular
RUN npm install -g @angular/cli

# Get files from repository
COPY . .

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Run angular app
RUN BACKGROUND ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check

# Show website on preview environment at port 4200
EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:4200
```

## Setting up the Layerfile

If you haven't already, please sign up to [webapp.io](/sign-up), and install
webapp.io onto your repository.

First let's breakdown each instruction in our Layerfile.

### 1: Set the Image

`FROM vm/ubuntu:18.04`

The `FROM` instruction tells webapp.io what base to use to run tests from. There
can only be one `FROM` line, and in this case we're using the `ubuntu:18.04`
virtual machine image.

If you're familiar with AWS Ec2 Instances, this is similar to creating a virtual
machine from the ubuntu 18.04 image.

### 2. Install NodeJS and NPM

`RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`RUN sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

`RUN sudo npm install npm@latest -g`

The `RUN` instruction will run the given script, and fails the Layerfile if the
script fails. In this case, we're using the `RUN` command to install the
dependencies we need to build and run the Angular application.

In this case we're using the `RUN` instruction to download Node JS and npm.

### 3. Install Angular

`RUN npm install -g @angular/cli`

Similar to the previous step, we use the `RUN` command but this time we're using
it to install Angular. This was the same step you ran when setting up Angular
locally.

### 4. Get Repository Files

`COPY . .`

The `COPY` instruction moves files from your repository to the virtual machine.
The Layerfile will pick up on the files in the repository that you are making
the commit for, and will copy those files into the virtual machine so you can
run you project.

### 5. Install Dependencies

`RUN npm install`

Similar to the `RUN` commands above, this will execute the given script
`npm install`, which will install the dependencies for the Angular app.

### 6. Start the Angular App

`RUN BACKGROUND ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`

The `RUN BACKGROUND` instruction is the `RUN` instruction with the `BACKGROUND`
flag. This tells webapp.io to continue to the next step in the Layerfile instead
of waiting for the given script to run. The reason why we do this is that
`ng serve` will essentially block the terminal while the Angular app is running.
We want to continue to the next step so that's why we use `RUN BACKGROUND` here.

### 7. Expose Angular App on the Virtual Machine

`EXPOSE WEBSITE http://localhost:4200`

The `EXPOSE WEBSITE` instruction creates a link to view the virtual machine at a
specific port. We use `EXPOSE WEBSITE` to expose the virtual machine on port
4200 which is where the Angular application runs after running `ng serve`. We
use `EXPOSE WEBSITE` here so we can get a link to our Angular app to share with
stakeholders involved in our projects.

## Adding the Layerfile

The last step in this process is to add the Layerfile to your repository. Simply
create a file called `Layerfile` (no file extension) in the root of your Angular
application. If you haven't already, install webapp.io onto your repository
containing your Angular app. Once done, simply create a commit and push your
Angular app to the repository with the new Layerfile. Webapp.io will pick up on
the Layerfile and build your Angular application according to the steps in your
Layerfile.
