<Tip>
Webapp.io is happy to announce hosting! Deploy your project directly to a virtual machine and connect it to a domain of your choice!

It's simple to deploy a virtual machine (VM) on webapp.io. To deploy a VM you'll need to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://webapp.io/sign-up">Sign Up</a> and connect your GitHub account to webapp.io. 

Webapp.io supports multiple languages, so if your stack runs on linux we probably support it. We can also build and deploy anything with a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. So whether you're running a Node JS, Python, Rails, Ruby, Elixir, Go, or Rust project, we have native support for it.

With webapp.io's deployment via our virtual machines, you get access to the following:

- Free virtual machines
- Webapp.io's quickstart experience that makes coldstarts feel hot
- Custom domains (including wildcard domains)
- Free SSL and Automated Certificate Management for TLS
- Debugging terminal to debug your virtual machine
- Virtual machine analytics (CPU, Disk, Memory)
- Preview environments on every commit
- Built-in CI/CD


<Note>
    Review the [Snapshots and Environment Lifecycle](/snapshots) docs to learn more about how we achieve a fast cold-start and what the state of your VM is.
