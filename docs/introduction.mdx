## What is webapp.io?

Webapp.io is a hyper-optimized DevOps platform for webapps.

We build testing VMs in *seconds* every time you push code to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

- Our VMs automatically hibernate when they aren't being used
- We let you duplicate VMs to make copies of your stack and run acceptance tests in parallel
- We take [snapshots](/snapshots) of the VM as it builds, so that future builds can entirely skip `docker pull` or `npm install`

### What happens when I sign up?

1. You'll install webapp.io onto a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository
2. Our onboarding will guide you to build a [Layerfile](../layerfile-reference/intro) which defines your VM build
3. You commit your Layerfile, and we'll automatically build it into a VM every time you push a commit.


### What can serverless VMs be used for?

Our users primarily use serverless VMs for three things:

1. Preview environments - by making a Layerfile with the [EXPOSE WEBSITE](../layerfile-reference/expose-website) directive, you immediately get an environment deployed for every pull request.
2. Acceptance tests - by making a Layerfile with [SPLIT 5](../layerfile-reference/split), you can build your stack and fork it five times to run tests in parallel.
3. Hosting - by using [webapp.io hosting](../hosting/introduction), you can make ephemeral environments stick around and not shut off.

At webapp.io, we're building a *serverless VM platform*. You can even create multiple Layerfiles and combine them into powerful DevOps workflows to help your team ship 10x faster.
